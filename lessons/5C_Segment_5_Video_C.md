## Introduction

In this segment we will extend on the lesson from segment 5B and talk about additional functionality in R to subset data from one-dimensional objects.

#### Selecting using indices with logical operators

R has a set of logical operators available that can be used to assess data within objects. E.g. if one is interested in extracting all the elements from age that were greater than or equal to a certain value, we can do that fairly easily. 

This is the full list of logical operators available in R. It includes "and" `&` and "or" `\|`, which are used to combine two or more of the operators together.

| Operator | Description |
| :-----------:|:----------------|
| > | greater than |
| >= | greater than or equal to|
| < | less than |
| <= | less than or equal to |
| == | equal to |
| != | not equal to |
| & | and |
| \| |or |


Let's use some of these with the `age` vector to get all the elements that are greater than 50.
	
```r
age

age > 50
```

Instead of returning the 3 elements that are actually greater than 50, we get a vector of TRUE and FALSE values. Let's take a closer look at this output.

* What is the data type of this output? It is logical
* What is the data structure of this output? It is a vector
* How many elements in the logical vector? 6
* Why are there 6 elements in this logical vector? Because the vector `age` has 6 elements

In conclusion, the output of `age > 50` is a logical vector of the same length as `age`. Every FALSE here corresponds to elements that are NOT greater than 50, and every TRUE corresponds to elements that are greater than 50.

```r
[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
```

Great, we can now use logical operators and understand the output. But we still need to extract the elements that are greater than 50 from the `age` vector. So how do we do this?

In addition to being able to place a vector of numeric values within the brackets to extract specific elements, we can also place a vector of logical values of the same length as the object being subsetted, within the brackets. Let's say we want to extract the values in the `age` vector that are either greater than 50 **or** less than 18.

We could write out the logical expression as follows with age greater than 50 separated from age less than 18 by a "pipe" which denotes "or" and save the logical vector output to a new object:

```r
logi_idx <- age > 50 | age < 18

logi_idx 
```
Then we can use this object to subset from the age vector

```r
age[logi_idx]
```

You could have also used nesting to do this with a single line of code

```r
age[age > 50 | age < 18]
```

##### Indexing with logical operators using the `which()` function

While logical expressions will return a vector of TRUE and FALSE  values of the same length, there is a function within base R called `which()` that takes a logical vector as input and returns the numeric index associated with each TRUE value.

```r
which(age > 50 | age < 18)
```

Since the output of which is a numeric vector of indices, it can also be used within the brackets.

```r
age[which(age > 50 | age < 18)]
```

`which()` stands for "which is true" and is useful when dealing with NA values.

### Factors

Since factors are special vectors, the same rules for selecting values using indices apply. The elements of the expression factor created previously had the following categories or levels: low, medium, and high. 

Let's extract the values of the factor with high expression, and let's using nesting here:

```r
expression[expression == "high"]    ## This will only return those elements in the factor equal to "high"
```

> **Nesting note**: 
>
> The piece of code above was more efficient with nesting; we used a single step instead of two steps as shown below:
> 
> Step1 (no nesting): `idx <- expression == "high"`
>
> Step2 (no nesting): `expression[idx]`


***
**Exercise**

Extract only those elements in `samplegroup` that are not KO (*nesting the logical operation is optional*).

#### Releveling factors

We have briefly talked about factors, but this data type only becomes more intuitive once you've had a chance to work with it.  Let's take a slight detour and learn about how to **relevel categories within a factor**. 

To view the integer assignments under the hood you can use `str()`:

```r
expression

str(expression)
Factor w/ 3 levels "high","low","medium": 2 1 3 1 2 3 1
```
The categories are referred to as "factor levels". As we learned earlier, the levels in the `expression` factor were assigned integers alphabetically, with high=1, low=2, medium=3. However, it makes more sense for us if low=1, medium=2 and high=3, i.e. it makes sense for us to "relevel" the categories in this factor.

To relevel the categories, you can add the `levels` argument to the `factor()` function, and give it a vector with the categories listed in the required order:

```r
expression <- factor(expression, levels=c("low", "medium", "high"))     # you can re-factor a factor 

str(expression)
Factor w/ 3 levels "low","medium",..: 1 3 2 3 1 2 3
```

Now we have a releveled factor with low as the lowest or first category, medium as the second and high as the third. This is reflected in the way they are listed in the output of `str()`, as well as in the numbering of which category is where in the factor.

> Note: Releveling becomes necessary when you need a specific category in a factor to be the "base" category, i.e. category that is equal to 1. One example would be if you need the "control" to be the "base" in a given RNA-seq experiment.

***
**Exercise**

Use the `samplegroup` factor we created in a previous lesson, and relevel it such that KO is the first level followed by CTL and OE.
