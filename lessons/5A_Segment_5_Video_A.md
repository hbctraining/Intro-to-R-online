## Introduction

Welcome to segment 5A, in this segment we will be talking about functions for inspecting data structures. In other segments, we have discussed what functions are, as well as the different data types & data structures available in R; here we will discuss a few functions to enable you to get information from a data structure, including figuring out the exact data structure you may be working with.

## Inspecting data structures

There are a wide selection of base functions in R that are useful for inspecting your data and summarizing it. In this segment we will be utilizing some of the data objects we have created in segments 2B and importing-exporting-data; specifically `metadata`, `glenghts`, `expression`. If you do not have these objects, you can follow the instructions provided below the video. 

** Add a read.csv() here to explicitly read in metadata **

Once you have these objects, we can get started.

Let's take a look at the `metadata` object by typing out its name and pressing return; the variable contains information describing the samples in our study. 

```r
metadata

          genotype celltype replicate
sample1        Wt    typeA		1
sample2        Wt    typeA		2
sample3        Wt    typeA		3
sample4        KO    typeA		1
sample5        KO    typeA		2
sample6        KO    typeA		3
sample7        Wt    typeB		1
sample8        Wt    typeB		2
sample9        Wt    typeB		3
sample10       KO    typeB		1
sample11       KO    typeB		2
sample12       KO    typeB		3

```
Each row holds information for a single sample, and the columns contain categorical information about the sample `genotype`(WT or KO), `celltype` (typeA or typeB), and `replicate number` (1,2, or 3).

What is the data structure of this object? You should be able to tell based on the fact that each column represents distinct sets of information, which is typical of a data frame. How do we check that it is a data frame?

There is a function called `class()` that enables us to do this.

```r
class(metadata)

[1] "data.frame"
```

It is important to note that character values get converted to factors (data type) by default using `data.frame()` or the `read.csv()` functions. One way to assess if that is what happened with the `metadata` object would be to use the `str()` (structure) function. This function provides detailed information about each column:


```r
str(metadata)

'data.frame':	12 obs. of  3 variables:
 $ genotype : Factor w/ 2 levels "KO","Wt": 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 ...
 $ celltype : Factor w/ 2 levels "typeA","typeB": 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 ...
 $ replicate: num  1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 ...
```

As you can see, the columns `genotype` and `celltype` are of the `factor` class, whereas the replicate column has been interpreted as integer data type.

__You can also get this information from the "Environment" tab in RStudio.__

For the `metadata` object we were able to just display all the contents of the data frame onto the console easily. Suppose we had a larger file with 100s of rows, we might not want to display all the contents in the console. In that case we can use the `head()` function to just display the first 6 rows/items from any object:

```r
head(metadata)

        genotype celltype replicate
sample1       Wt    typeA         1
sample2       Wt    typeA         2
sample3       Wt    typeA         3
sample4       KO    typeA         1
sample5       KO    typeA         2
sample6       KO    typeA         3
```

We could use the `head()` function on a factor or vector as well:

```r
head(expression)

[1] low    high   medium high   low    medium
Levels: high low medium
```

Similarly the `tail` function will display only the last 6 rows/items from a given object, try it out!


### List of functions for data inspection

In addition to the functions we discussed above, there are many other functions that allow you to get a sense of the content/structure of data. 

Some of these functions will work on **all data structures**, and we have already encountered most of these:
- **`str()`:** compact display of data contents (env.)
- **`class()`:** data type (e.g. character, numeric, etc.) of vectors and data structure of dataframes, matrices, and lists.
- **`summary()`:** detailed display, including descriptive statistics, frequencies
- **`head()`:** will print the beginning entries for the variable
- **`tail()`:** will print the end entries for the variable

Let's see what the `summary()` function returns for a vector and a data frame:

```r
summary(glengths)

   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    4.6  1502.3  3000.0 17668.2 26500.0 50000.0 


summary(metadata)

 genotype  celltype   replicate
 KO:6     typeA:6   Min.   :1  
 Wt:6     typeB:6   1st Qu.:1  
                    Median :2  
                    Mean   :2  
                    3rd Qu.:3  
                    Max.   :3  
```

As you can see the summary function is very useful not just for numeric/integer values, but also for factors.

Some functions, like `length()` will work on **one dimensional structures only**, i.e. vectors and factors:

```r
length(glengths)

[1] 3
```

And some others will work on **two dimensional structures** like data frames and matrices:

- **`dim()`:** returns dimensions of the dataset as a vector with two values
- **`nrow()`:** returns the number of rows in the dataset as a vector with a single value
- **`ncol()`:** returns the number of columns in the dataset as a vector with a single value
- **`rownames()`:** returns the row names in the dataset as a vector
- **`colnames()`:** returns the column names in the dataset as a vector

Let's try some of these out.

```r
dim(metadata)

[1] 12  3


ncol(metadata)

[1] 3


colnames(metadata)

[1] "genotype"  "celltype"  "replicate"
```

The list above is a non-comprehensive list of functions that can be used to inspect data structures. However, these are some of the more commonly used ones.

## Conclusion

Inspecting data structures is a very important aspect of working in R. It is often necessary to perform sanity checks on outputs from other functions or scripts to ensure that the results are as expected. Some of the functions listed above can also be used as input to downstream applications, for example the row names from a data frame might be required to extract information about specific rows.

Thanks for your attention.
