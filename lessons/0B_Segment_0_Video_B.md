## Introduction

Welcome to segment 0B, Introduction to R and RStudio. In this lesson we will describe what R and RStudio are and highlight some features of each.


## What is R?

A common misconception is that R is simply another programming language, but in fact it is much more than that. Think of R as an environment for statistical computing and graphics, which brings together a number of features to provide powerful functionality. A salient feature of R is that it can effieintly handle large volumes of data. R makes working with big data more manageable with access to a collection of integrated tools at your fingertips, reducing time spent hard-coding simple tasks. Moreoever, R is rich with facilities for creating and developing interesting graphics. And finally, R is a simple and effective programming language.

* efficient handling of big data 
* collection of integrated tools
* graphical facilities
* simple and effective programming language


## Why use R?

There are a number of different statistical software packages available, for example SAS, SPSS or Matlab. The question is then what makes R so favourable?

Well, to start R is open source. As you will have noticed

R is a powerful, extensible environment. It has a wide range of statistics and general data analysis and visualization capabilities.

* Data handling, wrangling, and storage
* Wide array of statistical methods and graphical techniques available
* Easy to install on any platform and use (and itâ€™s free!)
* Open source with a large and growing community of peers

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is freely available open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE). RStudio provides an environment with many features to make using R easier and is a great alternative to working on R in the terminal.
