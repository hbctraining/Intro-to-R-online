## Introduction

Welcome to segment 0B, Introduction to R and RStudio. In this lesson we will describe what R and RStudio are and highlight some features of each.


## What is R?

A common misconception is that R is simply another programming language, but in fact it is much more than that. Think of R as an environment for statistical computing and graphics, which brings together a number of features to provide powerful functionality. A salient feature of R is that it can effieintly handle large volumes of data. R makes working with big data more manageable with access to a collection of integrated tools at your fingertips, reducing time spent hard-coding simple tasks. Moreoever, R is rich with facilities for creating and developing interesting graphics. And finally, R is a simple and effective programming language.

## Why use R?

There are a number of different statistical software packages available, for example SAS, SPSS or Matlab. The question is then what makes R so favourable?

* To start, R is open source - this means R is free! It also means that R is actively developed and maintained by a community, and there are regular updates. 

* R is platform agnostic. It doesn't matter what type of computer and operating system you have, R can be easily installed and used. 

* R is a language designed especially for statistical analysis. All the R libraries focus on making data analysis easier. Members of the R community are very active and supporting and they have a great knowledge of statistics as well as programming. 

* R is very popular in data science, and is not specific to any one domain. It is especially useful for data wrangling, which is the process of cleaning messy and complex data sets to enable further analysis. This is a very important and time-consuming process in data science and R has an extensive library of tools for data handling, wrangling and storage.

* Finally, R has fabulous tools for data visualization. As data grows ever bigger and more complex, visualization becomes increasingly important in providing clarity and insight.

## What is RStudio?

Another requirement for working through these segments is to have RStudio installed. RStudio is a cross-platform integrated development environment or an IDE for the R statistical language. Similar to R, RStudio is also freely available and open source. It provides a graphical user interface and serves as a great alternative to working with R in the terminal. It has a host of features that make R easier to navigate and is a great learning tool.

* Platform agnostic
* Free for academic use
* Open source
* Graphical user interface, not just a command prompt
* Great learning tool 


## Conclusion
Before getting started in R, it is important to know a little bit about the software you are using and the benfits if using it. In this segment, we have highlighted some of the main features of R. Additionally, we describe RStudio, an intregrated development environment which makes working in R that much easier.
