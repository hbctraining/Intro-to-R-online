## Introduction

Welcome to segment 0B, Introduction to R and RStudio. In this lesson we will describe what R and RStudio are and highlight some features of each.


## What is R?

A common misconception is that R is simply another programming language, but in fact it is much more than that. Think of R as an environment for statistical computing and graphics, which brings together a number of features to provide powerful functionality. A salient feature of R is that it can effieintly handle large volumes of data. R makes working with big data more manageable with access to a collection of integrated tools at your fingertips, reducing time spent hard-coding simple tasks. Moreoever, R is rich with facilities for creating and developing interesting graphics. And finally, R is a simple and effective programming language.

## Why use R?

There are a number of different statistical software packages available, for example SAS, SPSS or Matlab. The question is then what makes R so favourable?

* To start R is open source, meaning that it is distributed with its source code available for modification. It includes a license for programmers to change the software in any way they choose. With open source comes an open community. There is a large and growing community of R users including individuals contributing to the R project by fixing problems and improving functionality.

* R is also platform agnostic. It doesn't matter what type of computer and operating system you have, R can be easily installed and used. Bonus, you will have noticed that it was free to do so!

* R is a language designed especially for statistical analysis. All the R libraries focus on making data analysis easier. Members of the R community are very active and supporting and they have a great knowledge of statistics as well as programming. 

* R is very popular in data science, and is not specific to any one domain. It is especially useful data wrangling, which is the process of cleaning messy and complex data sets to enable further analysis. This is a very important and time taking process in data science and R has an extensive library of tools for data handling, wrangling and storage.

* Finally, R has fabulous tools that can help in data visualization. This allows analyzing data from angles which are not clear in unorganized or tabulated data.

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is freely available open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE). RStudio provides an environment with many features to make using R easier and is a great alternative to working on R in the terminal.
